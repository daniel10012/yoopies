# France Median Salaries

The goal of this project is to serve data on average salaries in France so it can be used for cross analysis and in my particular case market targeting.
The data we use is available in open data in  [csv](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/salaire-net-horaire-moyen-selon-la-categorie-socioprofessionnelle-le-sexe-et-lage-en-2014/)  

Documentation for the API is available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6947361/SWLb8ouT?version=latest)
